## About The Project
![](pomodoro-gif.gif)

A simple pomodoro timer react app with dynamic background based on current weather conditions. We use the Open Weather Map API to make calls to a restful api to return the current weather data. For the pomodoro timer, we use the [React Countdown Circle Timer](https://github.com/vydimitrov/react-countdown-circle-timer) for smooth animation and displaying the timer. In making this app, we implemented all the basics in React.js such as Hooks, States, Props, Components, effects, API Call, Dynamic data display, Dynamic fetch data, etc.

The purpose of this project is to create an easy-to-use pomodoro timer app with a nice looking background that can be used for ourself or college friends. This project is already deployed on Netlify, feel free to use it: [https://pomodoro-habits.netlify.app/](https://pomodoro-habits.netlify.app/)
